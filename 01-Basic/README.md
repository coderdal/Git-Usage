## General Information

#### What is Git ?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 

So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.

Git is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are stored on your computer. You can also use online hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) to store a copy of the files and their revision history. Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others, enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the changes, so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without losing each other’s work!

### How to Get Started with Git
#### Terminal vs GUI
You can either use Git by typing commands in the terminal or you can use a graphical user interface (GUI) such as Sourcetree or GitKraken.

If you choose the terminal, you will have to look up which Git commands you will need.

Luckily you don’t have to learn these by heart. Other than a handful of commands that you will use most often, the rest you can look up whenever you need them (this is what most developers do, even those with decades of experience). Git offers in-depth documentation on their website.

If you choose to use a GUI, then the various actions you need to take will be displayed in a more visual manner.

Whether you choose to use the terminal or a GUI, you will need to understand the basics of how Git works in order to use it confidently.

### Git Repositories
A Git repository (or repo for short) contains all of the project files and the entire revision history. You’ll take an ordinary folder of files (such as a website’s root folder), and tell Git to make it a repository. This creates a .git subfolder, which contains all of the Git metadata for tracking changes.

On Unix-based operating systems such as macOS, files and folders that start with a period (.) are hidden, so you will not see the .git folder in the macOS Finder unless you show hidden files, but it’s there! You might be able to see it in some code editors.
