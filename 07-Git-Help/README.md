## Git Help

If you are having trouble remembering commands or options for commands, you can use Git `help`.

There are a couple of different ways you can use the `help` command in command line.

- `git command -help` -  See all the available options for the specific command
- `git help --all` -  See all possible commands

*Let's go over the different commands.*

### Git -help See Options for a Specific Command

Any time you need some help remembering the specific option for a command, you can use `git command -help`.

Ex:

`git commit -help`

**Note:** You can also use `--help` instead of `-help` to open the relevant Git manual page

### Git help --all See All Possible Commands

To list all possible commands, use the `help --all` command.

Ex:

`git help --all`

**Warning:** This will display a very long list of commands

**Note:** If you find yourself stuck in the list view, `SHIFT + G` to jump the end of the list, then `q` to exit the view.
