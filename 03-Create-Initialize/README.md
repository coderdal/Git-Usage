## Creating Git Folder

*Now, let's create a new folder for our project:*

    mkdir myproject
    cd myproject

`mkdir` makes a new directory.

`cd` changes the current working directory.

*Now that we are in the correct directory. We can start by initializing Git!*

### Initialize Git

*Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:*

    git init

You just created your first Git Repository!
